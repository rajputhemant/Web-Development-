            An online shopping cart is a core feature of any e-commerce website
            that allows users to select products and store them temporarily
            before completing a purchase. It works like a physical shopping
            basket in a store but in digital form. When a user clicks the “Add
            to Cart” button, the selected product’s details—such as name, price,
            quantity, and image—are saved in the cart. The cart allows users to
            view selected items, update quantities, remove products, and see the
            total cost before checkout. A shopping cart improves the user
            experience by giving flexibility to shop multiple items at once,
            compare prices, and finalize purchases easily. In modern web
            applications, the cart data is usually managed using JavaScript,
            Local Storage, or backend databases, ensuring that items remain
            saved even after page refresh. In my project, the shopping cart is
            designed with a user-friendly interface, responsive layout using
            Bootstrap, and dynamic functionality using JavaScript. It helps
            users manage their shopping smoothly and prepares the data for
            secure checkout and payment processing. he shopping cart also
            automatically calculates the total price, including quantity-based
            updates. This helps users clearly understand the cost before
            proceeding to checkout, improving transparency and trust. In modern
            web applications, the cart data can be stored using localStorage or
            sessionStorage on the client side, or in a database on the server
            side. This ensures that cart items remain saved even if the user
            refreshes the page or navigates to another section. From a UI
            perspective, the shopping cart is designed to be responsive and
            user-friendly, often built using Bootstrap for layout and styling.
            Clear buttons like Add to Cart, Remove, and Checkout make the
            process smooth and intuitive. Overall, the online shopping cart
            plays a critical role in the user journey by connecting product
            selection to payment, enhancing user experience, and increasing
            conversion rates for e-commerce platforms.
